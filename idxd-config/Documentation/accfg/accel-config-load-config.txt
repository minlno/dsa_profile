accel-config load-config(1)
===========================

NAME
----
accel-config-load-config - load pre-defined the configuration in json format

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'accel-config load-config' [<options>]

Load and scan through the pre-defined configuration file in json format,
and set the configured attribute into corresponding component.

There is a sample config file at /etc/accel-config/accel-config.conf.sample, and
it can be used as a reference for user about how the loadable config file looks
like, but it should not be used directly given the variance of each system. The
user should create a proper config file according to the format of sample file
and use "-c" option to point to the config file.

The "dev" property is used as the key for each json object and must be the
first entry in each object block.

Note: This feature is intended to be used with a configuration that was
previously saved using the save-config command. Manual editing of the
configuration file can produce unexpected results.
